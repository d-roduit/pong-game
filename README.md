## A fun experiment
I created this very simple pong game when I had free time in the public transport.

The main goal was to experiment and play with the HTML5 canvas features.

This game was not completely finished at the time I stopped developing it to devote myself to other more important real projects.

I still wish to make it work like a real basic pong should work and add it a multiplayer mode though.

Anyway, **have fun** playing with the dumb opponent player ! ‚úåÔ∏è

Your player bar is the one at the bottom.
